# Dynamic Flutter Example App

Welcome to the Dynamic Flutter Example App! This repository contains a simple application demonstrating how to integrate the Dynamic product with Flutter.

## Requirements

To run this example app locally, you will need a Dynamic account. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for free at [Dynamic](https://dynamic.xyz/).

With an account created, you can create a new project and obtain the environment ID, which you will need to initialize the Dynamic client in the example app.

You will also need to enable the SMS and/or Email Login options to have a login method available in the example app.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the app up and running:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:dynamic-labs/dynamic-flutter-example.git
   cd dynamic_flutter_example
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   cd ios
   pod install --repo-update
   ```
